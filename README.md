# SQLI tutor
I have experience of teaching different sqli techniques including inference attacks. This is the presentation document I prepared and used.<br />
I start off by talking about sql and its application in dynamic web development. Then tinker with it and see how it effects web application behaviour. From there I move towards classic sql injections. I showcase different types and scenarios. Finally introduce more advanced attacks like blind sql injections techniques. I also give some recommentations on resources to further practice the subject.
